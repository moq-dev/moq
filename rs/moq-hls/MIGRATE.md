# Migrating moq-hls

How to update your code for each breaking change, newest first.

## Unreleased

### Playlists take an optional range (#5705)

`export::Rendition::playlist(query)` is `playlist(range, query)`.
Pass `None` for the live or history playlist.

### Discontinuities are absolute sequences

`export::segments::Segment::discontinuity` is a `u64` sequence, absolute within one `Broadcaster`, instead of a `bool` or a per-cursor count.
Store the value with each segment and use the first retained one as `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE`.
A new `Broadcaster` starts a new sequence namespace: start a new recording, or map its sequences behind a discontinuity.

### Playlists are bounded (#4978)

Every timeline, durable ones included, lists a capped window of 256 segments.
Set `Config::history` to list a durable timeline past the window.
`master.m3u8` lists a video rendition only once a segment starts at a sync point, and answers 404 until one can start.

```rust
let mut config = moq_hls::export::Config::default();
config.history = true;
```

### `Broadcaster::new` is synchronous

`Broadcaster::new` no longer awaits or fails.
A rendition whose sibling broadcast ends now ends its playlist instead of rebinding to a replacement.
Drop the `.await?`.
