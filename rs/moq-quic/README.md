# moq-quic

MoQ's sans-IO QUIC state machine, a hard fork of [quinn-proto](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn).

All credit for the code goes to the quinn developers; it stays under quinn's MIT or Apache-2.0 license.

## Upstream

Forked from quinn-proto in quinn-rs/quinn `main` at [`7616e6b2`](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/commit/7616e6b2782722f3ce4a1b181ef08817d7f545e4) (2026-10-05).
That covers every quinn security advisory published through 2026-09-30.

The fork never merges upstream.
Upstream fixes are cherry-picked by hand, and the crate keeps quinn's formatting (rustfmt defaults) so the patches apply cleanly.
Rewrite quinn's crate path and name in the patch before applying it, so its context matches the renamed lines:

```sh
git -C ../quinn format-patch -1 --stdout <sha> -- quinn-proto \
  | sed -E 's#([ab])/quinn-proto/#\1/rs/moq-quic/#g; s/quinn_proto/moq_quic/g' \
  | git am -3
```

`Cargo.toml` hunks still need applying by hand, since the manifest renames the package and inlines quinn's workspace dependency specs.

### Carried changes

None besides the crate rename.

### Advisory triage

`cargo audit` cannot match the renamed crate, so security fixes are tracked by hand.
Watch quinn-rs/quinn's [security advisories](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/security/advisories) and releases (including the `0.11.x` branch, which sometimes gets a fix `main` does not need).
For each quinn-proto advisory, check whether the vulnerable code exists in this fork, and if it does, port the fix together with its regression test.
