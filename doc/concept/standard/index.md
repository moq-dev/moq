# Standards
MoQ is a big tent, full of many different opinions and ideas.
I consider any media protocol that uses QUIC to be part of MoQ, even if it's part of a standards body or organization.

Additionally, MoQ is experimental and not yet battle-tested, so expect all of these standards to change.
If you're interested in participating, join any of these communities and get involved.

## IETF MoQ Working Group
The IETF MoQ Working Group is the official standardization body for MoQ.
The group is primarily focusing on the [MoqTransport](/concept/standard/moq-transport) specification, but there's a number of other drafts too.

There's no membership fee or criteria to join.
If you want to participate, you should show up to the regular online (and in-person) meetings.
Once you get more involved, jump into the excessive number of [GitHub issues](https://github.com/moq-wg/moq-transport/issues) and join the [mailing list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/moq/).

## moq.dev
[moq.dev](https://moq.dev) is an open-source implementation of MoQ primarily focused on production usage.

The goal is to support compatibility with the IETF drafts, but not a full implementation.
The IETF process is slow and involves a lot of debate, discussion, and negotiation.
All of this is *on purpose* and produces a better standard in the end.

But the standard is too immature, full of bloat, and there's too much churn.
If we had to gate every change behind IETF approval, it would take months to make even the smallest change.

To that end we've created a subset of the standard called [moq-lite](/concept/layer/moq-lite) and [hang](/concept/layer/hang).
The concepts are very similar to [MoqTransport](/concept/standard/moq-transport) and [MSF](/concept/standard/msf) respectively, with the intent to converge some day.
