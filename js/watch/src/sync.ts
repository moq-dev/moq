 * late their frames arrive (see doc/concept/audio-jitter.md). A `Time.Milli` fixes the delay at
 * exactly that number and disables adaptation.
 *
 * `"instant"` drops the buffer and the pacing together: nothing is held, and {@link Sync.wait}
 * returns without sleeping, so a frame presents as soon as it exists. It also overrides
 * {@link SyncInput.buffer}, since holding a lookahead would contradict holding nothing. Audio is
 * the owner's business: a ring with no depth underruns, so whoever wants this mode is expected to
