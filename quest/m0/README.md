# m0: immediate priorities

## Goal

The work in flight now: a passing Nightly, fixes for the `release` line, the
quest merge driver, and CI cost and latency.

## Plan

The release API gates (#3829..#3878) and the release that followed them are
done.

Per-session request caps landed in #4820, idle fronts in #5054, and the
lost demand-poll wake in #5091.

Routing: Wildcard landed in #4403, so a service claims the prefix it could
serve instead of enumerating broadcasts. Serving the relay's ingested-only
view (`origin::Consumer::local()`) to localhost workers belongs to moq.pro's
edge, which embeds moq-relay; it moved there on 2026-09-28.

## Required

- [Nightly passes on main](/quest/m0/nightly/README.md) - the scheduled Nightly passes end to end, so red means a new break
- [Release shutdown backport](/quest/m0/ffi-shutdown-backport.md) - `release` publishes a non-breaking moq-ffi with an async `drain()` and qmux sessions on the QUIC stream limit
- [Adopt quest resolve](/quest/m0/quest-resolve.md) - local merges resolve concurrent quest link-list edits once kixelated/quest ships its merge driver
- [CI cost and latency](/quest/m0/ci/README.md) - cloud CI runs only in the merge queue as one `just ci` pass, expensive checks run nightly and gate `release`, caches move to R2, and runners are chosen last
